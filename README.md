**EmployeeManager**

Hi there and welcome to EmployeeManager! Are you looking for a way to manage your employees more effectively?
Do you find spreadsheets to be too time-consuming and difficult to use?
Or does your organization not have a proper employee management system in place?
If so, then EmployeeManager is the perfect solution for you!

EmployeeManager is a **desktop application** for **Human Resource** staff to 
**manage employees in a relatively large organisation** of about 50 - 200 employees.

* EmployeeManager is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* EmployeeManager is primarily a CLI application which allows fast typists to quickly type in commands faster than a traditional 
GUI interface.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**.
  * It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base with around 6KLoC.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[EmployeeManager Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t14-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
