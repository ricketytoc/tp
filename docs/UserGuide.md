Welcome to **EmployeeManager**! Do you need to manage employees? Are you having trouble using spreadsheets? Or does your
organisation not have a proper employee management system? EmployeeManager is the application for you!

EmployeeManager is a **desktop application** for **Human Resources (HR) staff** to **manage employees in a relatively
large organisation (about 50 - 200 employees)**.

Here’s an **overview** of EmployeeManager’s features:
* Consolidate and manage employee details in a single application 
* Conveniently view, add, or delete employee details

EmployeeManager is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EmployeeManager can get your employee management tasks done more
quickly than traditional GUI apps, so HR staff can be more efficient.

This User Guide aims to help both new and experienced users use EmployeeManager. Learn to leverage the features of 
EmployeeManager to make managing employees easier!

* If you have no prior experience with CLI or require a refresher, refer to this guide *(coming soon)*

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar employeemanager.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all employees.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Unable to assign employee ID : `There is no employee ID available to be assigned. Please delete unused employees 
to free up employee IDs`
* Too long name/position/department : `Please keep the <NAME/POSITION/DEPARTMENT up to 100 characters.`

**Q2**: Are the employees listed in the order of id or name?<br>
**A**: No, the new added employees will be placed from the end of the list.

**Q3**: Can I simply update certain details of an employee without deleting the old information?<br>
**A**: You can only delete and add the updated employee information again so far, the new `update` feature is coming soon!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
