Welcome to **EmployeeManager**! Do you need to manage employees? Are you having trouble using spreadsheets? Or does your
organisation not have a proper employee management system? EmployeeManager is the application for you!

EmployeeManager is a **desktop application** for **Human Resources (HR) staff** to **manage employees in a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME)**.

Here’s an **overview** of EmployeeManager’s features:
* Consolidate and manage employee details in a single application 
* Find and sort employees by various attributes
* Easily increment salary or delete many employees at once

EmployeeManager is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EmployeeManager can get your employee management tasks done more
quickly than traditional GUI apps, so HR staff can be more efficient.

This User Guide aims to help both new and experienced users use EmployeeManager. Learn to leverage the features of 
EmployeeManager to make managing employees easier!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `find [i/ID] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [d/DEPARTMENT] [r/ROLE] [s/SALARY_LOWER_BOUND - SALARY_UPPER_BOUND]` can be used as `find n/John Doe` or as `find n/John Doe d/finance`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sorting displayed employees : `sort`

Sorts the displayed list based on the specified employee's attribute in _ascending_ order.
EmployeeManager will automatically re-sort the displayed list based on the last specified attribute after any command
that updates the data. This will ensure that the list remains sorted even after modifications.

Format: `sort [i/] [d/] [e/] [s/] [r/] [n/] [p/]`

* **Exactly one of the prefix must be specified.**
* The prefix specifies the attribute to be sorted with. Refer to the [Prefix summary](#prefix-summary) for help on the mapping of the attribute and prefix.
* Attributes are sorted by _lexicographical order_. For example, "Alice" comes before "Bob",
  and "10" comes before "20". Keep in mind uppercase letters come before lowercase letters. For example, `Z` comes before `a`.
* Extraneous parameters entered after the prefix will be ignored. 
  * E.g. `sort s/123` will sort by salary, the value `123` will be ignored. 
  * E.g. `sort s/p/`, `p/` is treated as a value and not a prefix. Since the value `p/` is ignored, the command will sort by salary.

Examples:
* `sort i/` sorts the list by **ID**.
* `sort d/` sorts the list by **department**.
* `sort e/` sorts the list by **email**.
* `sort s/` sorts the list by **salary**.
* `sort r/` sorts the list by **role**.
* `sort n/` sorts the list by **name**.
* `sort p/` sorts the list by **phone**.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Incrementing multiple employees' salaries: `increment`

Increments the salaries of all employees in the displayed list in EmployeeManager by the given increment.

Format: `increment INCREMENT`
* `INCREMENT` can be positive or negative.
* `INCREMENT` is invalid if `INCREMENT` causes the salary of any employee in the displayed list to fall below 0 or exceed the maximum salary.
Should this happen, an error message identifying the first employee whose adjusted salary falls outside the allowed range will be shown.
* `INCREMENT` can have at most 2 decimals.

Examples:
* `increment 1000` increments the salaries of all employees in the displayed list by `1000`.
* `increment -100.65` decrements the salaries of all employees in the displayed list by `100.65`.

### Undoing a modification : `undo`

  Restores EmployeeManager to the state before the last command that made a modification to the data in EmployeeManager.
  Such commands include `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `increment` and `redo`.

  Format: `undo`

  Examples:
* `clear` followed by `undo` restores EmployeeManager to the state before `clear` was executed.
* `delete 3` followed by `sort n/` followed by `undo` restores EmployeeManager to the state before `delete 3` was executed.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Redoing the previous undone command : `redo`

Restores EmployeeManager to the state before the last `undo` as long as no command that made a modification to the data in EmployeeManager was executed since the last `undo`.
Commands that change the data in EmployeeManager include `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `increment` and `undo`.

Format: `redo`

Examples:
* `clear` followed by `undo`, followed by adding `John` and then `redo` will show `No more commands to redo!`.
* `delete 3` followed by `undo` followed by `find n/alex`, then `redo` restores EmployeeManager to the state after `delete 3` was executed.


### Clearing multiple employees' data : `clear`

Clears the current displayed list of entries from EmployeeManager.

Format: `clear`

### Importing data : `import`

Imports an EmployeeManager data file into the application.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

* Please refer to [Specifying data file path](#specifying-data-file-path) for help on usage of `FILE_PATH`.
* The data file must be of `.json` file type. Otherwise, an error message will be shown.
* The file path must be valid, and the application must have permission to read from the file.
* No changes will be made if the data file is invalid or not found.

Examples:
* `import ./persons.json` imports the `persons.json` data file from the same folder as EmployeeManager.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Danger:**
The import command will **overwrite** existing data in the application. If you wish to keep a copy of the existing
data, it is recommended to use the `export` command to save a copy of the current data.
</div>


#### GUI option
Alternatively, you may use the GUI option to import the data file if you are unfamiliar with file paths.
1. Click **File > Import** in the top left corner of the application.<br>
   <img src="images/ug-import-gui.png" width="243" />


2. The file explorer will open and prompt you to select the data file.
Only `.json` files can be selected as that is the expected format of the data file. _The file explorer will look different depending on your operating system._<br>
   <img src="images/ug-import-explorer.png" width="650" />


3. After opening your data file, EmployeeManager will attempt to load the data into the application.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Exporting data : `export`

Exports the data file in EmployeeManager to the specified path.

Format: `export FILE_PATH`

* Please refer to [Specifying data file path](#specifying-data-file-path) for help on usage of `FILE_PATH`.
* The data file must be of `.json` file type. Otherwise, an error message will be shown.
* The file path must be valid, and the application must have permission to save to the file path.
* Depending on your system and user permission, you might not be allowed to save to certain folders such as
`C:\Windows`. EmployeeManager will show an error message in such scenarios.

Examples:
* `export ./data.json` will create the data file in the same folder as EmployeeManager.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Danger:**
The export command will **overwrite** any file with the same name in the specified location.
</div>

#### GUI option
Alternatively, you may use the GUI option to export the data file if you are unfamiliar with file paths.
1. Click File > Export in the top left corner of the application.<br>
   <img src="images/ug-export-gui.png" />


2. The file explorer will open and prompt you to save the data file. _The file explorer will look
different depending on your operating system._<br>
   <img src="images/ug-export-explorer.png" />


3. After selecting your save location, EmployeeManager will attempt to save the data into the specified location.
   * The file explorer will save the file as a `.json` file format.
   * The data file can be given any _valid name_, e.g. `abc_pte_ltd.json` as shown in the image above.
   * Valid file name is dependent on the operating system.

### Viewing command history : `history`

Displays up to the last `N` valid user commands that have been executed, starting from the previous command. 
If the number of valid user commands is less than `N`, it shows all valid user commands that have been executed. 
Do note that `history` will only show you the executed commands for this session - it resets each time you close and relaunch EmployeeManager.

Format: `history N`
* N specifies the number of most recent valid commands to be displayed, not inclusive of the current `history` command.
* N must be a positive integer that is less than or equal to 1000.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<br>

Examples:
* `history 5` displays up to the last 5 valid user commands.
* `history 1` displays the most recent valid user command.
* `history 10` displays up to the last 10 valid user commands. 
If fewer than 10 commands have been executed, all available commands are shown.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Specifying data file path
The data file path used in `export` and `import` command must refer to a `.json` file. The extension `.json` is 
also case-sensitive. Valid file paths also depends on the operating system (OS). Listed below are
examples of different file path formats and their result.

| Path                   | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data.json`            | The file `data.json` in the same directory where `EmployeeManager.jar` is located in.                                                                      |
| `/Documents/data.json` | The slash `/` at the front represent an absolute file path from root of the **current drive**. E.g. It might point to `C:/Documents/data.json` in Windows. |
| `Documents/data.json`  | With no slash `/` at the front, it is a relative path from the directory where `EmployeeManager.jar` is located in.                                        |
| `./data.json`          | A dot `.` at the front is also a relative path from the directory where `EmployeeManager.jar` is located in.                                               |

* Valid files names can consist only of the extension without a name e.g. `.json`. On most systems, the file will be 
treated as a hidden file and only visible by changing settings. It is thus not recommended to export data file without 
a name.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Saving the data

EmployeeManager data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

EmployeeManager automatically saves your data as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/employeemanager.json`. 
For advanced users, you have the option to directly modify this data file to update records.
After editing, simply restart EmployeeManager to view the updated changes.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Danger:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EmployeeManager will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. 
To safeguard against potential data loss, we recommend backing up the original data file before directly editing it.

## FAQ

**Q1**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and replace the default data file it creates with the data file of your previous EmployeeManager.

**Q2**: Are the employees listed in the order of id or name?<br>
**A**: No, the employees are not listed in any explicit order. Newly added employees will be placed at the end of the list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
