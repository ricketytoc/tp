### Project: Employee Manager

EmployeeManager is a desktop application used by Human Resource (HR) staff in a relatively large company (of 50 - 200
employees). EmployeeManager provides HR management features to provide HR staff a convenient way to access and update
employee details. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 10 kLoC.
