### Project: Employee Manager

EmployeeManager is a desktop application used by Human Resource (HR) staff in a small or medium-sized company (of 50 - 200 employees).
EmployeeManager has HR management features to provide HR staff a convenient way to access and update employee details.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `history` command.
